# Predicting-Future-Bank-Loans-Status-Classification
We analyze the loan data obtained from a bank or financial institution, examining borrower attributes such as credit score, mortgage status, annual income, and years of employment. 
Our goal is to train a classifier that can predict whether a loan will be repaid successfully.
